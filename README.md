# CapstoneProject-AlgoVision-

Name: DRISHTI YADAV

OVERVIEW:

'AlgoVision' is a Data Structures and Algorithms based system designed as an e-commerce product management and budget optimization tool.

The project includes use of:

-Array

-Queues

-Binary Search Tree (BST)
-Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack Algorithm)
-Greedy Algorithms
-Modular Programming in C

It allows users to:
-Add products
-View sorted prices
-Search products
-Optimize spending within a given budget

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is to apply DSA concepts to build a structured and modular system that performs efficient product storage and search using BST, and budget optimization using the 0/1 Knapsack algorithm.

DSA USED:

-Array: To store product details.

-Binary Search Tree: To sort product prices and enhance searching.

-Queue: To manage order processing (first in -first out).

-Dynamic Programming: Used knapsack to find maximum amount a user can spend within a budget.

-Greedy Algorithm: For price prioritization.
