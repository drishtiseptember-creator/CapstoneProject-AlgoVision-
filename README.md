# CapstoneProject-AlgoVision-

Name: DRISHTI YADAV


OVERVIEW:

'AlgoVision' is a Data Structures and Algorithms based system designed as an e-commerce product management and budget optimization tool.

The project includes use of:

-Array

-Queues

-Binary Search Tree

-Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack Algorithm)

-Greedy Algorithms

-Modular Programming in C

It allows users to:

-Add products

-View sorted prices

-Search products

-Optimize spending within a given budget



OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is to apply DSA concepts to build a structured and modular system that performs efficient product storage and search using BST, and budget optimization using the 0/1 Knapsack algorithm.



DSA USED:

-Array: To store product details.

-Binary Search Tree: To sort product prices and enhance searching.

-Queue: To manage order processing (first in -first out).

-Dynamic Programming: Used knapsack to find maximum amount a user can spend within a budget.

-Greedy Algorithm: For price prioritization.

ABOUT PROJECT:

AlgoVision allows user to add products with their product id, price and quantity sold;search for products using their product id and if the product is found,its price is printed,else 'product not found' is printed;sort prices of products in low to high format; user enters budget and the system tells the user how much money he can spend effectively by making combinations;adds & processes orders; calculates how much revenue each product has collected using the details entered while addinf the products.
